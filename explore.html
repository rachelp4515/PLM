            <h2 class='card-header'> Library </h2>
            <p> Users will have the option to create their own library by adding songs through the form below or connect 
                their spotify account and add songs to their library by adding previously made playlists to the 
                library. When adding songs through the form, they can add tags to each song, or select multiple songs in the library 
                and pin the tags on anything selected. 
            </p>
                <div>

        <div id="custom-tag" class='card bg-primary border-2 p-3 m-3'>
            <h2 class='card-header'> Custom tags </h2>
            <p> Users can create custom tags to pin to their songs, or use the pre-made genre and mood tags. Users can add, 
                edit, and delete any tag. Tags can be pinned either when adding songs to the library or by selecting songs and then 
                choosing which tags to pin on them.  </p>

        <div id="make-list" class='card bg-primary border-2 p-3 m-3'>
            <h2 class='card-header'> Generating the playlist </h2>
            <p> This is the main feature of the app. Users will be able to generate a playlist that can     be 
                temporary or saved. To create the playlist, they select the tags they want their playlist to be based off of, 
                then an amount of time or number of songs indicating how long they want the playlist to be. For example, 
                let's say you have an hour long car ride coming up. You want some good rock jams, but specifically ones where 
                the drums go dum-dum-da-dum-dum instead of da-dum-dum-da-dum-dum. Luckily, you made a tag for that, because God 
                knows what music app would. You generate your playlist in just a few taps and go on your merry musical way. </p>
